# HR-TABLEAU-Dashboard

This project utilizes Tableau to analyze and visualize trends in a human resources dataset, focusing on demographics, income, age, and salary patterns. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, and calculated fields were created to highlight key insights.

The dashboard includes visualizations showcasing demographic breakdowns, income distribution, and age-salary trends. Interactive features allow users to filter and explore specific groups, providing a clear understanding of workforce composition and salary dynamics. This project demonstrates how Tableau can effectively reveal insights for data-driven decision-making in HR management.
